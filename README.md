# Reimplementation of ActorForth in Haskell

## Haskell
Currently the type checker and type inferencer is implemented for
proof of concept.

### Examples
- `1 2 +`
```
位> solve defaultWords (assembleP [LitI 1, LitI 2, Cmd "add"])
Right (T "Int" :- Bot)
```

- `3 False swap`
```
位> solve defaultWords (assembleP [LitI 3, LitB False, Cmd "swap"])
Right (T "Int" :- (T "Bool" :- Bot))
```

- `1 False +`
```
位> solve defaultWords (assembleP [LitI 1, LitB False, Cmd "add"])
Left "Failed to unify Int and Bool"
```

- `swap drop +`
```
位> solve defaultWords (assembleP [assembleF [Cmd "swap", Cmd "drop", Cmd "add"]])
Right ((T "Int" :- (TV "t2" :- (T "Int" :- TV "t1"))) :->
       (T "Int" :- TV "t1") :- Bot)
```


## Python Notes
Run ./setup under a python 3.7+ virtual environment for best results.

Then run ./interpret  samples/fundamentals01.a4 to see it run a simple script.

Run ./interpret by itself to get the repl.

See [ActorForthDefinition](docs/ActorForthDefinition.md) for a quick overview of how the language works.

Experiments implementing an Actor-style programming language on top of
a stack-based processor will be forthcoming as the system is
developed.
